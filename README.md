# Insomnia

Prevents your windows machine from going to sleep. Also prevents Lync from going inactive.

The main grunt work of this program was made by someone else. Most of this code is refactored code from the ImWorkin.zip file found here:

I have changed
- The key being pressed when poking the system to F15
- Added some extra functionality for advanced usage (see the interval class).
- The program runs as a process in the background.

To stop the process: Run the program again or kill the process via task manager.
