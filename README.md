# Insomnia

Prevents Lync from going inactive. Also prevents your windows system from going to sleep.

The main grunt work of this app was made by someone else. Most of this code is refactored code from the ImWorkin.zip file found here: https://www.symantec.com/connect/downloads/readynosleepexe-prevents-screensaver-and-pc-locking

I have changed the key being pressed when poking the system to F15, and added some extra functionality in the Interval class.
